We worked to complete the contract our rivals failed.  Through careful preparation we fought back the Inox.  It seemed this was just a village with families. What have we done? Jekserah was happy with us though and offered us one more contract, to retrieve a large diamond from a mine, overrun with Vermlings (#9). Argeise, a female Quatryl from the city guard caught us as we left and warned us of Jekserah’s ignoble intentions. She suggested we sneak into Jekserah’s warehouse to expose her for what she truly is (#8).
