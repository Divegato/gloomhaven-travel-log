The Ja Boiz have made their first public appearance in the Arena of Blood and Glory. We went in as underdogs, and came out as champions. Our challengers cowered in fear, barely leaving their starting rooms as we expertly outplayed them at each turn. At least thats what it looked like to the crowd. From our point of view we were frantically running in circles and it was the traps and a last ditch show of strength and sacrifice that brought us to the finish line. After leaving the arena filled with roaring cheers from the crowd, we stumbled upon a merchant selling a unique dagger in the bazaar. Apparently it was stolen, because soon after purchasing, mercenaries from the Merchants Guild surrounded us and threw us in prison.
