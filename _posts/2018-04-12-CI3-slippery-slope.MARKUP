We struggled up the difficult cavern trail, dodging oozes as we could. Mr. Splinter jumped over a wall (which was probably impossible), and was startled to find two wind demons on the other side. He immediately used his invisibility cloak to hide, but the wind demons now knew we were here. They rushed past the boulder and threw Urt off of the cliff into a small cavern filled with living corpses. Getting back up would not be easy, but at least there seemed to be some treasure to claim down there. Bramble Wood wanted it for himself, so he jumped down into the cavern and claimed it in front of Urt. We really needed to get back on track. After making it through the roughest part of the trail, we heard hounds behind us chasing. The internal competition had to stop for us to survive. We helped each other make it through to the next room with very little health to spare. Ahead we saw a boulder supporting a large amount of rocks and debris. If we destroyed it the path behind us would be blocked and we could escape in relative peace. With the last of our energy we rushed past the boulder and smashed it.  The resulting landslide crushed all of our pursuers, so we headed in the only direction remaining, forward.
