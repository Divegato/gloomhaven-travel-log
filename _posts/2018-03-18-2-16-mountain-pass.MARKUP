We were ambushed as we travelled through the mountain pass by a group of inox working together with demons. Evvos was pulled into a tunnel by a group of wind demons and attacked ruthlessly. Though we charged in to help, the damage was already done and Evvos was forced to leave the battle. With fewer numbers, the battle was even more difficult, but we pulled through in the end and cleared the path. It seems as though there is a voice calling us from deep within the caverns (#24). We are clear to continue our journey if we choose (#25).
