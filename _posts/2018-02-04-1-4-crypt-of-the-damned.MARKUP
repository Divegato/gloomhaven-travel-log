We went in search of answers to what is this “Gloom”.  We found that beyond raising the dead, they are also summoning elementals from another plane of existence.  Prince Krysa was near exhaustion, and we convinced him to loot a treasure before he gave up (#46).  It turned out to be a poison trap… oops.  Through the cultists’ notes, we found we can either disrupt the cultists (#5), or help them (#6).
