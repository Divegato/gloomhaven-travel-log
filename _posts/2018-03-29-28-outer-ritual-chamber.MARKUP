The battle was long and we all pulled the last of our strength together for one final attack.  Teedo couldnâ€™t reach the final enemies. Reah attacked weakly leaving one Sun Demon with two health remaining, Prince Krysa used his final strong attack to finish off the other Sun Demon.  Using the last bit of strength he had, Rocksbee III swung at the final Sun Demon defeating it and claiming the battle as a victory.
