We travelled to the diamond mine and faced against the Merciless Overseer and his army of Vermlings.  We were victorious and recovered a large diamond.  We delivered the diamond to Jekserah, and she stated that with it she could summon an entire army of undead.  We now have the opportunity to fight on the side of the undead to overthrow the military of Gloomhaven (#11) or to warn the city guard and join them to stop Jekserah and her evil plans (#12).
