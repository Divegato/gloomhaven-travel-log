We headed out to disrupt the cultist activities and found them summoning elementals from another plane of existence. Our team fought hard and defeated them for now, but the portal remained open. It seems we could travel through it if we wanted (#10). Alternatively we could work with an Aesther enchanter in Gloomhaven to close the rift, but she would require us to complete some favors for her first (#14) (#19).
