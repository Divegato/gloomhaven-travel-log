We met the Valrath merchant Jekserah who offered our party some gold to retrieve some stolen goods from a nearby bandit hideout. We found their lair and discovered that they are raising the dead within. We cleared the dungeon but the bandit commander escaped to his lair (#2). In a treasure chest (#07) we found a map marked with a side quest (#67).
