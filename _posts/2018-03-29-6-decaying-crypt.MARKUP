We cleared the crypt with the hope of gaining favor with the cultists.  It seems we succeeded.  A hooded cultist thanked us for our efforts and offered us a deal.  If we were to kill the rival necromancer Jekserah, they would consider overlooking the fact that we’ve already killed many of their ranks.  It’s a fine deal for us since our rival party has already accomplished this goal.
