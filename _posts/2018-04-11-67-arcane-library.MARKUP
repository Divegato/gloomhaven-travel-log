We have been here before.  Last time we were ill-equiped, weaker, inexperienced. Now we knew what to expect. We barrelled through the cave bears and imps and jumped through the flooded hallway. There we faced the Arcane Golem for a second time. This enemy had more health than anything we have fought before.  It took all of our teamwork to bring it down.  In the end, it seemed pleased that we have ended its cursed existence. This seems to be just a piece of a greater mystery. Once back in Gloomhaven we bartered with a merchant for an old sea map. There may be treasure there (#93).
