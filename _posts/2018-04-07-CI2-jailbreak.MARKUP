"The Sin-Ra wants you dead" Ironically, the Harrower's attempts to kill us are the only reason we escaped. We took turns climbing out of the jail cell through the hole in the ceiling where our attackers had entered. The guards were on patrol and we slowly snuck by. We probably could have escaped without a fight had we not seen the treasure chest along the guards' path. After Zam Wesell found our gear we caught the attention of a few guards and took them out one by one as they entered the hallway. Though we rushed for the treasure, Zam was by-far the quickest of us all and claimed the Protective Charm within for themself. We easily dispatched the remaining guards and escaped out into the sewers below the prison. We finally reached an intersection where a tunnel began to slope upwards. The smell coming through was horrifying, so we decided to find our own way out. Urt helped us to climb out into a natural cavern and up a cliff face.  Along the way we found some gems worth 20 gold.
