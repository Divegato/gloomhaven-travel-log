We warned the city guard about Jekserah's plans, and they joined us in the fight to stop her. Together we overran her army of undead and defeated her. "You have no idea what's coming" she warned as she took her last breath (#28). The captain of the guard was impressed with us and gave us a few additional contract opportunities, to investigate dragon rumors in the mountains (#16), or to deal with poison monsters in the sewers (#18).
