It turns out that the "Sparkle Kids" found a portal to the plane of elemental power, AND THEY JUST WALKED AWAY! Who knows what kind of treasure we would find there. We had to find out. Once on the other side, we found ourselves in a magma filled cavern. An ominous voice yelled out at us from all around and then spawned demons of various elements. We had expected a fight and so we unleashed our own power back onto the demons. They fell, one after another. When the last demon turned to dust, the voice told us he was impressed and summoned us deeper into the depths of the cavern. Once face to face this lord of the underworld made us an offer, to complete a mission for him in the temple of the elements back on our home plane (#22), or to die where we stand(#21).
